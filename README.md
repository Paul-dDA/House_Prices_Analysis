# House_Prices_Analysis
House Price EDA project for data science course
The primary goal of the House Price EDA project is to perform an exploratory data analysis on the Kaggle House Prices dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and prepare the data for future machine learning tasks. Specifically, it aims to:

Learn Python and Data Science Tools:
Gain hands-on experience with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Practice setting up a coding environment (Task 1) and using Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.
Understand the Dataset:
Understand the Dataset:
Inspect the dataset’s structure (rows, columns, data types) and quality (missing values, outliers).
Summarize key characteristics, such as missing values and data types, as you did in Task 2 (Steps 1-4).
Develop EDA Skills:
Explore relationships between features (e.g., house size vs. price) through visualizations and correlation analysis (upcoming Tasks 3-5).
Identify which features (like GrLivArea or OverallQual) might be important for predicting house prices.
Prepare for Machine Learning:
Clean the dataset by handling missing values and creating new features (Task 4).
Lay the groundwork for building a simple machine learning model (e.g., linear regression) in the next project.
Practice Real-World Workflows:
Use GitHub to organize and share your work (as you’re setting up in Task 2).
Mimic a data scientist’s process of analyzing data, documenting findings, and sharing results with a team.
